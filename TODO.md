- Promisify: steal code from https://github.com/normalize/native-or-bluebird
- Lint/hint
- Return object instances with getters etc (tests can be simplified)
- Assert metadata objects have more than just "id" property or throw a "not found"
- Make a lower-level API that exposes Buffers etc.
- Make an API that supports partial results?

		- GitHub release.
		- Release notes update.
		- Add version and link to documentation index.
		- Update "latest stable" pointer in GitHub pages.
	- Indexes for readmes/big markdown files. Doctoc?
- Tests
	- CI system
	- Empty and full folders explicit tests
	- Support nonstandard hosts from integration config
	- Grunt verify no busted symlinks
	- Test different node versions, document compatibility
- Badgez: built with grunt, npm package, travis, cov, nodei.co, stability

- Remove old/warning packages.
- Document v1/v2 compatibility.
- Remove most of functionutils
- Make a mock service for testing, rather than a mock client.
