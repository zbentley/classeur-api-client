- Promisify: steal code from https://github.com/normalize/native-or-bluebird
- Lint/hint
- Make OO: Return object instances from getters, rather than flat "objects". Tests can use instanceof then.
- Assert metadata objects have more than just "id" property or throw a "not found"
- Make a lower-level API that exposes Buffers etc.
- Make an API that supports partial results?
- Documentation
	- Automate releasing. The following steps can be templated/rolled into the build:
		- GitHub release.
		- Release notes update.
		- Add version and link to documentation index.
		- Update "latest stable" pointer in GitHub pages.
	- Indexes for readmes/big markdown files. Doctoc?
- Tests
	- Empty and full folders explicit tests
	- Support nonstandard hosts from integration config
	- Grunt verify no busted symlinks
- Badgez: built with grunt, cov, nodei.co, stability
- Fix assertions: second param to all ctors should be assertion text, not the param to the assertion end.
- Document v1/v2 compatibility.
- Remove most of functionutils
- Make a mock service for testing, rather than a mock client.
- Break github pages publication out into a grunt module
