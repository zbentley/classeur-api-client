- JSON.parse error handling
- Promisify: steal code from https://github.com/normalize/native-or-bluebird
- Use a different rest lib with better doc, maybe https://github.com/danwrong/restler
- Lint/hint
- Return object instances with getters etc (tests can be simplified)
- Assert metadata objects have more than just "id" property or throw a "not found"
- Gruntify documentation generation, tests, etc.

	- nb: auth failure is silent; 404s ensue

	- Move all JSdoc settings into jsdoc.json
	- Figure out how to better represent variadic functions: maybe flag pluralized functions with multiple signatures via plugin/template?
	- Host on github pages
- Tests
	- Unit tests with DI
	- CI system
	- Empty and full folders explicit tests
	- Support nonstandard hosts from integration config
