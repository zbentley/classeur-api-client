- JSON.parse error handling
- Promisify: steal code from https://github.com/normalize/native-or-bluebird
- Use a different rest lib with better doc, maybe https://github.com/danwrong/restler
- Lint/hint
- Return object instances with getters etc (tests can be simplified)
- Assert metadata objects have more than just "id" property or throw a "not found"
- Make a lower-level API that exposes Buffers etc.
- Use Chai for type assertions at runtime, too.
- JsDoc
	- nb: auth failure is silent; 404s ensue
	- nb: multi-getters are o(n) query cost
	- nb: uses https for everything
	- JSDoc deduplicate via mustache self-templating plugin?
	- Figure out how to better represent variadic functions: maybe flag pluralized functions with multiple signatures via plugin/template?
- Tests
	- CI system
	- Empty and full folders explicit tests
	- Support nonstandard hosts from integration config
- Badgez: built with grunt, npm package, travis, cov, nodei.co
