Pull the source code and hack away. Unit TestsTo run unit tests, do npm test or grunt test:unit. Integration TestsTo run integration tests, that actually talk to the API, do the following: Add information to test/asset/private/integration-test-resources.json. In addition to your Classeur user ID and API key, add the path to an existent file for existentFile and an existent folder with at least one file in it to existentFolder. existentEmptyFolder can be left alone; it is not yet used. Run the tests against the real API: grunt test:integration. The tests are the same when run as unit tests or integration tests; the only difference is whether they run against a stubbed REST client or a real one. DocumentationBuilding the Main DocumentationDocumentation is generated, and, optionally, pushed to GitHub pages via a grunt-based build process. Generated documentation is placed in doc/generated. The doc/generated folder will be removed and re-created as part of any documentation build. To generate documentation from the JSDoc in the code, do grunt doc:master or grunt doc:current-version. The names of the two functions are a bit deceptive: both will generate documentation from the branch and version of the module from which you are running grunt. The difference is that the former places the documentation into the doc/generated/master file, and the latter places it in the doc/generated/$version file, where $version is the NPM package version from package.json. Building the Version Index Documentationgrunt doc:index can be used to build just the documentation landing page, which contains links to multiple module versions' documentation. grunt doc:index is implied as part of all other grunt doc tasks. The index will live in doc/generated/index.html. Unless you build a version's documentation in addition to the index, links in the index will not work. Pushing Documentation to GitHub PagesYou can add :push to either the doc:master or doc:current-version Grunt task to push the resulting documentation product to GitHub pages, e.g. grunt doc:master:push. Before pushing, the build system will delete and re-create the index documentation (regardless of target), and documentation for the version-named (or master-named) folder you are targeting, depending on which Grunt task you're pushing with. × Search results Close "},"tutorial-Plural Functions.html":{"id":"tutorial-Plural Functions.html","title":"Tutorial: Plural Functions","body":" classeur-api-client Tutorials Developer's GuidePlural FunctionsRelease NotesOther Versions Plural Functions Plural FunctionsIn this module, there are several functions that operate over multiple things. For example, getFiles operates over multiple file IDs, and getUsersMetadata operates over multiple user IDs and metadata objects. Each such function can be called in one of two ways: with an array of things to operate on, or with a list of arguments. I call these 'Plural Functions'. Calling a function with one or the other signature does not affect its internal behavior or its return types in any way. Callbacks that expect an array of results will still receive that array, regardless of the signature used for the function to which a callback is passed. If you don't need to operate on multiple things, all plural functions have a single version, named without the plural (e.g. getFile is the singular version of getFiles, getUserMetadata is the singular version of getUsersMetadata, etc.). The singular versions don't return arrays to their callbacks; they just return the single JSON object corresponding to the supplied ID. ExamplesgetFolders is a plural function. It has two signatures: One with arrays of IDs: getFolders(new Array(id1, id2, ...), function(error, results) { ... }) ...and one with variadic IDs, ...ids: getFolders(id1, id2, ..., function(error, results) { ... }) It can be called like this: // new Array('folder id 1', 'folder id 2', 'folder id 3'), Array.of, or any other constructor would work just as well. clientInstance.getFolders(['folder id 1', 'folder id 2', 'folder id 3'], (error, results) =&gt; { if ( error ) console.log(`Got an error: ${error}`); if ( results ) results.forEach((result) =&gt; { console.log(`Got a result: ${result}`)}); })...or like this: clientInstance.getFolders('folder id 1', 'folder id 2', 'folder id 3', (error, results) =&gt; { if ( error ) console.log(`Got an error: ${error}`); if ( results ) results.forEach((result) =&gt; { console.log(`Got a result: ${result}`)}); })Both snippets do exactly the same thing. The above examples use ES6 arrow functions and template strings. Follow those links if either syntax is unfamiliar to you. Why?Functions on a general-purpose, public API should follow the 'don't make me think' school of usability design. While (in my impression) conventions for various projects/frameworks/environments lean in favor of passing Arrays of arguments to functions rather than variadic argument sections, that convention is far from universal (and the introduction of rest parameters makes it poteltially likely to change). APIs and utility code in general should not dictate coding style more than absolutely necessary. It should document behavior as clearly as possible, and then get out of the way and let users code in whatever style is most familiar and useful to them. When you import a new module, read the manual, and start writing code, the last thing you want is to write a function call and then stop, scratch your head, and wonder 'does this take an array or an argument list?' Even if the documentation (or failure of tests) clearly indicates one or the other, the very act of stopping development, wondering if something is correct, and then getting sidetracked while you research or test your assumption functions a lot like a hardware interrupt; it's something that should be avoided if possible. Developers have only so much time and cognitive bandwidth; why waste it worrying on which of several equally-semantically-sensible call syntaxes to use when the answer can be 'whatever you want' without loss of functionality? Does this require ES6 Rest Parameters?No. It just simulates them. Once rest parameters are more widely supported, that might change. × Search results Close "},"tutorial-Release Notes.html":{"id":"tutorial-Release Notes.html","title":"Tutorial: Release Notes","body":" classeur-api-client Tutorials Developer's GuidePlural FunctionsRelease NotesOther Versions Release Notes Release Notes0.1.0 Initial release. 0.1.1 Documentation fixes.
