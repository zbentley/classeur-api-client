Pull the source code and hack away. Unit TestsTo run unit tests, do npm test or grunt test:unit. Integration TestsTo run integration tests, that actually talk to the API, do the following: Add information to test/asset/private/integration-test-resources.json. In addition to your Classeur user ID and API key, add the path to an existent file for existentFile and an existent folder with at least one file in it to existentFolder. existentEmptyFolder can be left alone; it is not yet used. Run the tests against the real API: grunt test:integration. The tests are the same when run as unit tests or integration tests; the only difference is whether they run against a stubbed REST client or a real one. DocumentationBuilding the Main DocumentationDocumentation is generated, and, optionally, pushed to GitHub pages via a grunt-based build process. Generated documentation is placed in doc/generated. The doc/generated folder will be removed and re-created as part of any documentation build. To generate documentation from the JSDoc in the code, do grunt doc:master or grunt doc:current-version. The names of the two functions are a bit deceptive: both will generate documentation from the branch and version of the module from which you are running grunt. The difference is that the former places the documentation into the doc/generated/master file, and the latter places it in the doc/generated/$version file, where $version is the NPM package version from package.json. Building the Version Index Documentationgrunt doc:index can be used to build just the documentation landing page, which contains links to multiple module versions' documentation. grunt doc:index is implied as part of all other grunt doc tasks. The index will live in doc/generated/index.html. Unless you build a version's documentation in addition to the index, links in the index will not work. Pushing Documentation to GitHub PagesYou can add :push to either the doc:master or doc:current-version Grunt task to push the resulting documentation product to GitHub pages. Before pushing, the build system will delete and re-create the index documentation (regardless of target), and documentation for the version-named (or master-named) folder you are targeting, depending on which Grunt task you're pushing with.&lt;%- path %&gt; × Search results Close "},"tutorial-ReleaseNotes.html":{"id":"tutorial-ReleaseNotes.html","title":"Tutorial: Release Notes","body":" classeur-api-client Tutorials Developer's GuideRelease NotesOther Versions Release Notes Release Notes0.1.0 Initial release. 0.1.1 Documentation fixes.
